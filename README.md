# Hi there 👋 I’m Krishna Chidrawar

Computer Science + Economics @ UIUC. I enjoy building practical systems that sit at the intersection of software, data, and real-world impact. I’m especially drawn to projects where engineering decisions directly influence outcomes at scale.

🚀 **Currently**
- Undergraduate student studying **CS + Economics** at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign  
- Building **ClaimScout**, a web-scraping and data aggregation platform designed to identify and organize potential claimants for class-action lawsuits

🛠️ **Featured Project**
### **ClaimScout**
An end-to-end web scraping and data pipeline tool that helps surface eligible claimants for class-action lawsuits.
- Crawls public records, forums, and structured datasets
- Cleans, deduplicates, and normalizes large volumes of semi-structured data
- Applies rule-based and ML-assisted filtering to flag high-confidence claimant matches
- Designed with scalability, compliance, and transparency in mind

🌱 **Interested in**
- Software engineering  
- Full-stack web systems  
- Backend infrastructure & data pipelines  
- Machine learning & applied AI  
- Blockchain & emerging technologies  

🏔️⚽🏃 **Outside of tech**
